  <h1>Rodney “Roddy” Ellsworth Jenkins</h1>
  <h2>1930 – 2025</h2>

  <p>Rodney “Roddy” Ellsworth Jenkins passed peacefully yesterday, just as he lived: tragically unaware of what a camera angle is. His final moments were spent recording content for his proudly dreadful YouTube satire channel — a digital graveyard of punchlines nobody asked for.</p>

  <p>Roddy was preceded in death by his long-suffering caretaker, Sam — not due to illness, but from the emotional toll of supplying Roddy with toilet paper during the Great COVID Shortage (because Roddy couldn't afford it, and honestly, probably wouldn’t have paid even if he could).</p>

  <p>Roddy is survived by his life partner, <strong>Alejandro Ratatoolie Fuentes</strong>, who brought love, financial stability, pool chlorine, and consistent STD screening into Roddy’s chaotic life. Also mourning his loss is best friend <strong>Dave Ateepee (Sarah)</strong>, who maintained daily contact through Roddy’s 56k dial-up connection for over two decades — a commitment stronger than most marriages.</p>

  <p>Roddy’s twin brother, <strong>Lik Ick</strong>, survives him as well — genetically, phonetically, and unfortunately, behaviorally identical. His nephew <strong>Jack Netradio</strong>, fondly remembers Roddy’s enthusiasm for hand-me-downs clothes from “the closet”</p>

  <p>His granddaughter, <strong>Jess Kash Rejester</strong> (aka “Ginger”), holds the distinct honor of being the only family member he remembered without a sticky note. And of course, his most unlikely confidante, <strong>Peggy Benda</strong> — a woman who transitioned from stalker victim to begrudging ally, sharing countless dramatic landline calls, broadcast rebuttals, and eventually, an oddly touching reconciliation. It was complicated. Just like her rotary phone induced finger injury(see Bobb for details).</p>

  <p>Roddy lived simply, like his mind. He rarely left his recliner unless it caught fire — which it often did, thanks to the four packs of Camel non-filters he smoked daily. His deep, gravelly voice once led a New York Walmart to report a prank call from “Barry White.” Ironically apt, considering Roddy’s questionable affiliations and the whiteness of both his bed sheet robes and his complexion.</p>

  <p>Roddy was also a passionate fisherman, though his fishing was strictly Wii-based. When the console finally gave out, so did his only healthy hobby. Financially reckless yet somehow HOA-compliant, he managed to scrounge up enough from his foundry pension and Alejandro’s Social Security checks to keep his tiny smoke-infested studio condo — which overlooked either manatee corpses or a poorly funded aquarium exhibit. It was unclear.</p>

  <p>Despite his neighbors’ constant fire alarm complaints, Roddy was elected honorary secretary of his HOA. Though to be fair, they only gave him that title so they could give him the wrong meeting times.</p>

  <p><strong>Donations</strong> in Roddy’s honor may be made in the form of Camel Cash or expired diner coupons. Or, send a letter to his HOA. They won’t read it — but neither would or could Roddy.</p>

  <p><strong>A memorial service</strong> will be held daily (for the next 10 minutes) on the <strong>Jackielee100 Internet TV Show</strong>. Please leave your tributes, memories, or conspiracy theories there. Or don’t. Honestly, he would’ve preferred you didn’t.</p>
