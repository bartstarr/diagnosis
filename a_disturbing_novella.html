    <p>Peggy Benda, a woman whose platinum hair rivaled the gleam of her meticulously curated collection of designer handbags, considered her rent-controlled studio in New York City a quaint eccentric detail, not a financial necessity. “It’s about the <strong>address</strong>, darling,” she’d declare, adjusting a silk scarf that likely cost more than most people’s monthly rent. Her humor, much like a surprise root canal, was often excruciating and delivered without anesthetic. She adored Don Rickles, which was less a preference and more a blueprint for her daily interactions. Her main joy, aside from polishing her latest Birkin, was meticulously dissecting the online marriages of strangers, a hobby born from a profound lack of her own. This, she’d assure anyone within earshot, was perfectly compensated by her “modest pension” and “a few, you know, dozen degrees.”</p>

    <p>Thousands of miles away, in a digital ether Peggy likely believed was powered by pure chutzpah, lived Trip Khoade, a video producer whose actual production likely involved more cat videos than Cannes contenders. Their seven-year virtual love affair, a romance as substantial as a whisper in a hurricane, was an enigma. Peggy, in moments of extreme sentimentality, would coo, “My <strong>Trippypoo</strong>,” a term of endearment that made strong men blanch. Their passion was the stuff of legend, at least in Peggy’s mind, which was good, because it certainly wasn’t the stuff of reality. They’d never met, of course. Why spoil a perfectly good fantasy with, you know, actual human contact? Entonces,  there was an episode with Trippypoo's waterbed that is so disturbing it could never be included in even the darkest of novellas.</p>

    <p>Then, like a forgotten grocery list, Jeremiah Orenthal Bonaparte, or “<strong>JOB</strong>” as Peggy affectionately dubbed him, shuffled onto the virtual stage. JOB, a man whose life choices suggested a dartboard with “poor decisions” as the bullseye, was there for Peggy after the explosive, albeit purely textual, implosion of her relationship with Trippypoo. Peggy’s affection for JOB was as unrequited as a mime’s serenade, yet a perplexing bond persisted. It was a connection so confusing, it likely sent both their therapists scrambling for stronger medication. This relationship, too, was strictly virtual. Because, let’s be honest, in-person interactions required effort, and Peggy was too busy instigating marital discord online.</p>

    <p>The emotional fallout from Trippypoo’s digital defenestration and JOB’s persistent romantic obliviousness turned Peggy into an even more formidable online warrior. Her anonymous married "friends" (who likely questioned their life choices after every interaction with Peggy) bore the brunt of her increasingly acerbic wit. It was, frankly, exhausting to witness.</p>

    <p>Eventually, Peggy’s digital diatribes reached a crescendo that even her most dedicated online adversaries couldn’t ignore. This led to a mandatory consultation with a Dr. <strong>Violation Portal</strong>, a name that struck fear into the hearts of anyone with a modicum of good sense. The ensuing diagnosis, a medical novella detailing Peggy’s every neurosis, was, to Peggy’s utter horror, leaked onto the dark web. The humiliation was profound, the kind that makes one wish for a quick, merciful internet outage. But Peggy, ever the master of self-deception, spun it into a “tribute,” proudly proclaiming it an homage to her unique… <em>essence</em>. Because nothing says “I’m fine” like pretending a leaked psychiatric report is a badge of honor.</p>

    <p>In the end, it was all too much. The manufactured outrage, the feigned pride, the sheer exhaustion of maintaining her online persona. Peggy retreated, not to a quiet life of reflection, but to the deepest, most obscure corners of the internet. There, she typed her impenetrable diatribes, streams of consciousness so convoluted that even the most seasoned dark web denizens scratched their heads. Peggy, the woman who once demanded the world’s attention, now typed for an audience of precisely no one, forever caught in the digital echo chamber of her own making.</p>

    <p>Do you think Peggy ever truly understood the irony of her own digital existence?</p>
