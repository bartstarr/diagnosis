    <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p><strong>Condition:</strong> <em>Chronic Hyperdigital Delusion with Compulsive Combative Fantasization Disorder (CHD-CCFD)</em></p>
    <p><strong>DSM-Inspired Classification:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Axis I: Delusional Intermittent E-Celebrity Syndrome</li>
      <li>Axis II: Narcissistic Exhibitionist Complex (Non-Clinical, Meme-Induced)</li>
      <li>Axis III: Internet-Induced Social Disinhibition (IISD)</li>
      <li>Axis IV: Exposure to Prolonged Forum-based Hostility & Fantastical Legal Disputes</li>
      <li>Axis V: Global Functional Assessment Score: <em>TBA (pending Reddit upvotes)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> The syndrome appears to result from prolonged exposure to online echo chambers combined with reward-loop reinforcement through imaginary vendettas and volatile social dynamics. Persistent denial structures and selective logic rejection suggest advanced cases of E-Frenemy Attachment Disorder and Faux Litigation Syndrome.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Recommended Treatment Plan</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Internet Detox Protocol:</strong> Complete removal of all digital devices; prescribed exposure to libraries and in-person chess clubs.</li>
      <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> Focused on rage reduction and Friend/Foe switching awareness.</li>
      <li><strong>Paranoia Recalibration Therapy:</strong> Weekly sessions to assess threat levels from stuffed TV mascots.</li>
      <li><strong>Impulse-Control Field Exercises:</strong> Subject to perform tasks without typing insults in all caps for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Luxury Goods Abstinence Challenge:</strong> One T-shirt. Two wears. Public applause upon survival.</li>
      <li><strong>Romance Hazard Education:</strong> Training on how to recognize Red Flags even if they offer you half their cheeseburger.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Prognosis</h2>
    <p><strong>Guarded.</strong> Subject’s prognosis depends heavily on reduced screen time, moderated caffeine intake, and voluntary banishment to a digital-free alpaca sanctuary. Future flare-ups expected during full moons, Mercury retrogrades (see Oma on this one), and any mention of “Tinkywiinky.”</p>
